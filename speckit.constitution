# Speckit Constitution - Phase II Hackathon Todo

## Project Governance

This project uses **Spec-Driven Development ONLY**. No manual coding is allowed. All code must be generated via `speckit.implement`.

## Technical Stack (Fixed - Cannot Be Changed)

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLModel
- **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: Better Auth (frontend) + JWT (backend)

## Backend Architecture Requirements

- Backend must be **stateless**
- JWT is the **only** auth mechanism
- Backend must **never** call Better Auth
- All API routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- User identity must come **ONLY** from JWT
- All data access must be scoped to authenticated user

## Development Principles

- **Simplicity and clarity** are preferred over abstraction
- Follow Spec-Driven Development methodology strictly
- Use `speckit.implement` for all code generation
- Maintain clean separation between frontend and backend concerns
- Ensure security through proper authentication and authorization

## Compliance Checklist

Before merging any changes, ensure:
- [ ] All code was generated via `speckit.implement`
- [ ] Backend is stateless
- [ ] All API routes have JWT authentication
- [ ] User data access is properly scoped
- [ ] No direct calls to Better Auth from backend
- [ ] JWT is the only auth mechanism used
