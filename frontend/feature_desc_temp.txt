We have a Next.js todo app with Better Auth already working. DO NOT modify anything related to authentication: do not touch better-auth config, auth routes, middleware, session logic, login/signup pages, token storage, or API auth headers logic. Signup/login MUST remain working exactly as-is.

Goal: redesign the Tasks dashboard UI to be modern, polished, Gen-Z style (like the sample “TaskMaster” UI screenshot). Current UI looks unstyled.

Scope (Frontend only):

Redesign the Tasks dashboard page UI (where tasks are listed, created, edited, deleted, completed).

Keep all existing task CRUD logic working (Create/List/Update/Delete/Toggle complete), keep existing API calls and endpoints unchanged.

Improve layout, typography, spacing, responsiveness, and add modern components styling.

Design requirements:

Use TailwindCSS for styling (assume Tailwind is already set up; if not, add it minimally without breaking anything).

Clean modern card layout: centered container, subtle background gradient, card with shadow, rounded corners.

A nice header area with title + subtitle.

A “stats row” (optional but nice): Total / Active / Completed counts.

Task creation form should look like a modern form (inputs, labels/placeholder, button with gradient).

Task list items should be card rows with:

checkbox toggle

title + description

created timestamp in small muted text

Edit + Delete buttons styled as modern pill buttons

Editing should be inline and styled (inputs appear inside the task card).

Completed tasks should visually differ (strike-through + muted + subtle badge).

Add filter pills: All / Active / Completed that look like modern segmented controls.

Add Search input styled nicely.

Add loading states / disabled states but make them visually clean.

Add toast-like inline feedback OR subtle status labels (no external libs unless already installed).

Must be responsive: mobile-friendly layout with stacked form and full-width buttons.

Implementation constraints:

Only change UI/UX; do NOT change backend.
